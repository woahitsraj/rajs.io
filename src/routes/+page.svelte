	<p>
		I'm a developer currently at <a href="https://subskribe.com/">Subskribe</a>. I program in
		React/Svelte and Node but I'm always learning new things. For me programming isn't just a
		career, it's been a lifelong hobby.
	</p>
	<p>
		I attend development related meet-ups and conferences, listen to development podcast and I am
		always itching try new things which got me hooked onto React and Svelte early.
	</p>
	<p>
		I'm a strong believer in long periods of undistracted "deep work" as popularized by Cal Newport
		to perform at a high level. I speak English natively and I speak Japanese ðŸ‡¯ðŸ‡µ and Swedish ðŸ‡¸ðŸ‡ª at
		conversational fluency.
	</p>
	<p>I'm an American ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸ and Canadian ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡¦ citizen but currently I call Sweden ðŸ‡¸ðŸ‡ª my home</p>
